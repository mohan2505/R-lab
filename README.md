- RStudio “Help” and “Plots” panes
- Discuss doubts with instructor/TA during lab hours

## Code & Report Requirements

- Use clear variable names and proper indentation.
- Include comments and brief interpretation of outputs.
- For statistical exercises, state the conclusion in simple words.
- Ensure scripts run from top to bottom without errors.

## Resources

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (online book)
- [CRAN R Documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)

## Academic Integrity
